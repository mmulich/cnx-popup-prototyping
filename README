Pyramid comes with a built in server that has been derived from
PasteDeploy.

Run the application by chaning into the package's root. This is so
that you have easy access to the configuration INI, otherwise you can
run it from anywhere and just reference the INI file.

    pserve development.ini

Then surf to the address output by the above command.
